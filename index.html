        <h3>Valorant Details</h3>
        <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.
            Teased
            under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April
            7, 2020,
            followed by a release on June 2, 2020.</p>

    <div class="vdts">
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.[3][4][5][6] Players play as one of a
        set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.[6] In the main game mode, players
        are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique
        abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths,
        orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability"
        charges.[4] Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based
        on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed</p>

    <div class="vdts">
        <h3>Unrated</h3>
        <p>In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The
        attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple
        specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it
        detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.[4] If the defending team can deactivate
        the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team
        receives a point.[12] If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of
        the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point</p>
    </div>
    <div class="vdts">
        <h3>Competitive</h3>
        <p>Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank
        to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode.[15][better
        source needed] In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing
        a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team
        claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns
        and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players
        may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1
        player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has
        3 tiers.[16][better source needed] Radiant is reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and
        Radiant have a number associated to their rank allowing players to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank
        up to others at their leve</p>
